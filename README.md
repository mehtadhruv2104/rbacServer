# rbacServer

This is a custom Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System to manage user roles and
permissions dynamically. Have used the Django framework and its inbuilt SQL to 
implement it.

The Objectives are simple

Every user can be assigned a predefined role which has a set of permissions 
according to which the access to resources is decided.
